Probabilistic G-BERT V4: Entity-Aware vMF Distribution for Text Embedding

A novel text embedding approach that represents text as Von Mises-Fisher (vMF)
distributions on hyperspheres rather than deterministic point vectors.

Core Innovation: "Intensity implies Certainty" - emotional intensity is modeled
as the concentration parameter (kappa) of a vMF distribution.
